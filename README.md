# geometricLongevity

Purpose of this repo: to explore the epigenome, from methylome to telomeri-ome to gene regulatory pathways (as well as MRI & other imaging data) with especial regard to iPSCs, blood, bone, skin, arterial, reproductive & neural cells & tissues. The end goal is threefold: a) tissue age prediction, b) death clock (more generally: obsolescence timer), & c) schematics optimization for cyborg tissue foundational work.

How: ML, DL, GDL, Transfer Learning, CAD, MD, CFD, metrics optimization, geometry processing.

Why: To exponentially increase the lifespan of earthen flora & fauna today and from here on out, or achieve 'Theseus Immortality'*.

Current projects: MCML/MC3DCNN, BAML/BA3DCNN.
